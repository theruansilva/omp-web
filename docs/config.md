# PI WEB configuration reference

PI WEB configuration covers the machine-local and project-local settings you usually need: the web/API bind address, trusted development-host settings, UI preferences, plugin enablement, file-explorer path access, manual upload defaults, upload limits, and session-daemon tools.

This file is the markdown reference for agents and package consumers. The website page is <https://omp-web.dev/config>.

## Config files

PI WEB uses two config files:

- **Global PI WEB config:** `$OMP_WEB_CONFIG`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/omp-web/config.json`, or `~/.config/omp-web/config.json`.
- **Project-local PI WEB config:** `<project>/.omp-web/config.json` for commit-able project settings.

Each PI WEB machine has its own config. When using Fleet/machine federation, Settings uses the selected machine for config that affects work running there: session daemon tools, PI WEB plugin enablement, external path access, and upload defaults. Gateway/browser-only settings stay local to the gateway: keyboard shortcuts, remote machine registry/tokens, and gateway host/port/allowed-hosts. Remote servers that do not advertise selected-machine settings support report those settings as unavailable instead of silently falling back to the gateway.

Pi package settings are separate from PI WEB config. They live in Pi's package-manager settings on the target machine and are managed by Pi (`pi install`, `pi remove`, `pi update`) or **Settings → Pi packages**. In a federated setup, **Settings → Pi packages** targets the currently selected machine. The PI WEB `plugins` config key only enables or disables discovered PI WEB browser plugins on the machine whose config you are editing; it does not install, remove, or update Pi packages.

If you installed services with a custom config path, rerun `omp-web install --config /path/to/config.json` after changing that path or after upgrading from a version that only applied the custom path to the web service. This regenerates service files so the web/API and session daemon use the same `OMP_WEB_CONFIG`.

## Precedence and reloads

Machine-global runtime values are resolved as:

```text
defaults → global config file → environment overrides
```

Supported project-local settings are then applied for that project's workspaces. For upload defaults, `<project>/.omp-web/config.json` overrides the global value.

Environment overrides include `OMP_WEB_HOST`, `OMP_WEB_PORT` / `PORT`, `OMP_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `OMP_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `OMP_WEB_SPAWN_SESSIONS`, and `OMP_WEB_SUBSESSIONS`.

Process restarts depend on the key:

- `host` / `port`: restart the gateway web/API service or process.
- `maxUploadBytes`: restart both the web/API process and the session daemon on that machine.
- `spawnSessions` / `subsessions`: restart the session daemon on that machine.
- `pathAccess`: applies on the next request; existing file views may need a browser refresh.
- `uploads.defaultFolder`: applies to newly opened Files upload dialogs and new direct drag/drop batches after config/workspace refresh.
- `plugins`: reload the browser tab after changing PI WEB plugin enablement.
- Pi package install/remove/update: not a PI WEB config key; after a mutation, type `/reload` in each idle PI WEB session on the target machine to refresh Pi runtime resources such as extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and context/system prompt files as supported by Pi. Reload the browser page separately for PI WEB browser plugin changes. A routine session daemon restart is not required.
- `shortcuts`: saved settings apply in the browser after config refresh/save.

## Global config example

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8504,
  "pathAccess": {
    "allowedPaths": ["~/SDKs", "/opt/reference"]
  },
  "uploads": {
    "defaultFolder": ".omp-web/uploads"
  },
  "maxUploadBytes": 67108864,
  "spawnSessions": true,
  "subsessions": false,
  "plugins": {
    "updates": { "enabled": true },
    "info": { "enabled": false }
  },
  "shortcuts": {
    "core:view.chat": "mod+1",
    "core:session.stop": null
  }
}
```

## Project-local config

Project-local config lives at `<project>/.omp-web/config.json`. Use it for settings that should follow a repository.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "pathAccess": {
    "allowedPaths": ["~/SDKs", "/opt/reference"]
  },
  "uploads": {
    "defaultFolder": "manual/uploads"
  }
}
```

Project-local `pathAccess.allowedPaths` entries are merged after the global list and deduplicated. Paths must still be host-absolute or `~`-prefixed; relative roots are not supported.

Project-local `uploads.defaultFolder` overrides the global upload destination for workspaces in that project. Current PI WEB servers include this workspace-effective value on the existing workspace responses used locally and through machine federation. Older remote servers may omit the optional field; the browser falls back to the global/default upload folder.

Plugins may own separate project files, such as `.omp-web/tasks.json` for the built-in Workspace Tasks plugin.

## Configuration matrix

Rows with JSON key `—` are runtime-only environment variables, not config-file keys. `Global` means machine-global. In Settings, selected-machine-safe global keys (`pathAccess`, `uploads`, `maxUploadBytes`, `spawnSessions`, `subsessions`, and `plugins`) are edited for the selected machine; gateway host/port/allowed-hosts, keyboard shortcuts, and machine registry/tokens stay local.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Config-file keys** |  |  |  |  |  |

## Key details

### External path access

`pathAccess.allowedPaths` grants PI WEB's file explorer and absolute `@` path completions access to specific filesystem roots outside the current workspace.

By default, workspace-relative file reads stay inside the workspace and absolute paths are denied. Add only roots you trust PI WEB to list and read through the browser UI.

Accepted root forms:

- Unix absolute paths: `/opt/reference`
- Home-relative paths: `~/SDKs`
- Windows absolute paths on Windows hosts: `C:\Users\dev\SDKs`

When an absolute request is served, PI WEB expands `~`, canonicalizes the configured roots with `realpath`, requires roots to be existing directories, and rejects symlink escapes outside the allowed roots.

In **Settings → General**, external filesystem roots are saved on the selected machine. Gateway host, port, and allowed-hosts fields stay on the gateway config.

This is not a sandbox for the underlying Pi Coding Agent or your OS user. It only controls PI WEB UI/API file exposure outside a workspace.

### Manual upload defaults

The Files panel can upload one or more files in two ways:

- Drop files onto the Files panel to upload immediately to the workspace-effective default folder.
- Use the toolbar **Upload** button to open the review dialog, edit the destination, and opt into upload options.

`uploads.defaultFolder` sets the workspace-effective default destination. The built-in default is `.omp-web/uploads`; a global config value applies to every project unless `<project>/.omp-web/config.json` sets a project-local override.

```json
{
  "uploads": {
    "defaultFolder": "manual/uploads"
  }
}
```

The value must be a non-empty workspace-relative folder. PI WEB normalizes repeated separators and backslashes to `/`, and rejects absolute paths or `..` traversal. In the upload dialog only, clearing the destination field uploads that batch to the workspace root.

Manual uploads use the workspace file-write path: paths stay workspace-relative, parent folder creation is enabled by default, and overwrite is disabled by default. Direct drag/drop always keeps `overwrite` off; the review dialog lets you explicitly enable overwrite when needed. Browser-owned XHR progress is shown per batch/file, conflicts and errors stay visible in the upload progress UI, and the final file-write response is the source of truth.

For machine federation, Settings saves the global upload default on the selected machine. Current remote PI WEB servers also return `workspace.effectiveConfig.uploads.defaultFolder` on the existing workspace-list response. Older remote servers can omit that optional field without breaking clients; the Files panel falls back to the global/default upload folder.

The per-request size limit is still controlled by `maxUploadBytes` / `OMP_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` on the machine serving the upload.

### Session daemon tools

`spawnSessions` controls whether agents receive the `spawn_session` tool. It defaults to `true`; set it to `false` if you do not want an agent to start independent PI WEB sessions.

`subsessions` is beta and controls whether agents receive the tracked-subsession tools: `spawn_subsession`, `list_subsessions`, `check_subsession`, and `read_subsession`. It defaults to `false` and also requires `spawnSessions` to be enabled.

Tracked subsessions let an agent delegate work to child sessions, get notified when children stop working, and inspect their transcripts.

In **Settings → Session daemon**, these keys are saved on the selected machine. Restart the session daemon on that machine after changing them.

### Plugin config

The `plugins` key is only for PI WEB browser plugin enablement/settings on the machine whose config you are editing. It does not install, remove, or update Pi packages; use **Settings → Pi packages** or Pi's package manager for package operations. In a federated setup, **Settings → PI WEB plugins** and **Settings → Pi packages** both target the currently selected machine, and each panel labels where changes will be saved or run.

Plugins are enabled by default. Set `plugins.<id>.enabled` to `false` to remove a plugin from that machine's `/omp-web-plugins/manifest.json` before the browser imports it. Settings lists discovered plugins from the selected machine, including disabled entries exposed by that machine.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "updates": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

### Shortcut config

Shortcut values are keyed by action id. Values are shortcut strings such as `mod+k` or `mod+g p`; `null` disables that action's shortcut.

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "core:view.chat": "mod+1",
    "core:session.stop": null
  }
}
```

Prefer Settings → Keyboard for editing shortcuts interactively.

## Optional completion tools

File and path `@` completions work without extra tools. If `fzf` is available on the PI WEB server's `PATH`, PI WEB uses it to improve completion filtering/ranking; otherwise it falls back to built-in ranking.
