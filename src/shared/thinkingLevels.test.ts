// Compile-time drift guard: if pi ADDS a thinking level we do not know about,
// `Extra` becomes that level and this assignment fails to type-check. Combined
// with the `satisfies readonly ThinkingLevel[]` clause in thinkingLevels.ts
// (which catches removals/renames), this pins KNOWN_THINKING_LEVELS to pi's
// union exactly. When this breaks, update KNOWN_THINKING_LEVELS and give the new
// level a label/description where thinking levels are presented.
// `inherit` is intentionally excluded from KNOWN_THINKING_LEVELS — it's a
// meta-level meaning "defer to parent", not a user-facing intensity.
