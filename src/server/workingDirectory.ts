 * 2. Data omp-web writes itself (archive store records): canonicalized on write
 *    and on load with `canonicalizeStoredCwd`, so internal `===` comparisons are
 *    safe by construction.
 * 3. Data other writers own (Pi session file headers via the SDK): canonicalized
 *    on read at the gateway, and compared tolerantly with `cwdPathsEqual` where a
 *    raw value can still appear (e.g. runtime cwd of sessions opened from files).
 *
 * Inside these boundaries, plain string equality on cwd values is safe.
