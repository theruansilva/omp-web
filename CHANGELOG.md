## 1.202606.7

### Patch Changes

- b17faeb: Improve chat, prompt, and session text rendering for RTL and mixed-direction content.
- 7e812aa: Allow chat composer attachments to save and mention general files while preserving native inline image delivery for supported image-only batches.
- 47c9b66: Fix `omp-web doctor` "can find npm/pi" checks on fish. The `--version` check
  wrapped the version command in a POSIX subshell `(cmd --version 2>&1 || true)`,
  which fish parses as a command substitution in command position and rejects
  (`command substitutions not allowed in command position`), producing a false
  negative. Emit fish's `begin; ...; end` grouping when the service shell is fish.
- b14205e: Highlight within-line changes in the Git diff viewer.
- cb13af4: Add a manual sessions cleanup flow that previews and confirms archiving idle sessions and deleting old archived sessions, with per-project selection and capability guidance for unsupported machines. Actions can now expose disabled reasons so unavailable remote-machine actions stay visible with an explanation.
- e46d9ec: Add manual Files panel uploads with direct drag/drop, an options flow from the Upload button, safe non-overwrite defaults, visible per-file progress/error reporting with clear failed/cancelled terminal states, and project-local default destinations.
- 32ea809: Add a Keyboard shortcuts setting for choosing whether Enter sends chat messages or inserts new lines in this browser, with Shift+Enter performing the opposite action when supported, while preserving the desktop-vs-mobile default (desktop Enter sends; mobile/coarse/narrow Enter inserts a new line).
- a99696b: Persist tracked subsession links in session history so parents can list, check, and read child sessions after the session daemon restarts, and reopened children can resume parent notifications.
- 27a3b2b: Add workspace file mutation (`files.writeFile`, `files.deleteFile`, `files.moveFile`) and prompt editor (`prompt.insertText`, `prompt.getText`, `prompt.getSelection`) APIs to the plugin system. File mutations work for local and federated machines, enforce workspace path safety, and auto-refresh the File Explorer.
- 9980027: Expose the plugin prompt editor helper in workspace panel contexts so panel interactions can insert text into the current prompt.

## 1.202606.6

### Patch Changes

- c479a0d: Fix the session daemon startup when PI WEB runs with compatible Pi packages that moved legacy provider registry exports to the Pi AI compatibility entrypoint.

## 1.202606.5

### Patch Changes

- c2e2a29: Add a dedicated PI WEB configuration reference covering config-file precedence, project-local config, external path access allowlists, session daemon tools, plugins, shortcuts, upload limits, and environment variables. Custom `omp-web install --config` paths are now passed to the session daemon service as well as the web service, and the session daemon now honors config-file `maxUploadBytes` values.
- 4f4c6fa: Fix remote session reloads so they proxy through the web/API instead of returning the app shell as JSON.
- 62c2234: Prevent live skill-loading cards from duplicating when the finalized transcript groups multiple skill reads.
- 27bc924: Persist the Settings → Session daemon tracked subsessions toggle so it remains enabled after restart.
- d931101: Fix dead-key/IME input in the terminal (e.g. typing `~` on a Swedish keyboard). The character previously stuck in the top-left corner and was never sent to the shell. The terminal panel now includes the xterm composition-view styles and no longer forces the helper textarea's position with `!important`, so dead-key composition is placed at the cursor and committed correctly.
- 6933d3a: Keep mobile navigation on the selected session when remote workspace loading finishes out of order.
- 2bb6e48: Normalize allowed external path suggestions on Windows so configured absolute paths use platform separators consistently.
- 9cc20d6: Allow configured external filesystem roots to be listed, read, configured from the global settings UI, and completed from absolute `@` path suggestions while keeping absolute paths denied by default, advertise workspace-scoped file suggestion support as a remote-machine capability, and use `fzf` when available to improve file/path completion filtering.
- 355ebe8: Add tracked subsessions (beta, off by default): agents can spawn child sessions they stay attached to. The new `spawn_subsession` tool starts a child session linked to its parent (recorded in the session tree), notifies the parent when the child stops working, and lets the parent inspect children via `list_subsessions`, `check_subsession` (a quick glance at a child's status and latest output), and `read_subsession` (read through a child's transcript with role/content filters, full-content substring search, optional per-value `maxChars` truncation that flags clipped parts, and pagination). The completion notice is delivered as a system-authored message (not attributed to the human), and still wakes an idle parent while queueing behind any in-flight work. Unlike the fire-and-forget `spawn_session`, subsessions are observable by their spawner.

  The capability is gated behind a beta flag so it can ship without being exposed in releases: enable it with the `OMP_WEB_SUBSESSIONS` env var, the `subsessions` config key, or the "Allow agents to start tracked subsessions" toggle in Settings → Session daemon. It also requires `spawnSessions` to be enabled. Requires a manual session daemon restart to take effect.

## 1.202606.4

### Patch Changes

- 53b00c4: Show a per-session sending indicator while messages with image attachments are uploading. Previously the composer cleared instantly while the upload, server-side image resizing, and first-session open happened in the background, so it looked like nothing was happening. The chat activity dock now shows "Sending your message…" for the originating session (including the folder-mode upload step), and that session shows the activity dot in the session list so progress is visible even after switching away. The indicator is scoped per session, so it no longer leaks onto other sessions or machines, and the upload itself continues in the background regardless of navigation.
- cfb7493: Improve user/assistant message distinction in the dark theme. Previously the user and assistant message backgrounds were nearly identical (contrast ratio ~1.06), making it hard to tell speakers apart. The dark theme's user-message background was lightened and decoupled from the generic hover color, and the user border brightened, so user turns stand out clearly.
- dd23b3e: Fix a duplicate session appearing in the list when starting a new session. The `session.created` broadcast (added with the spawn_session tool) could race ahead of the start request's HTTP response in the same tab, leaving two badges with the same id — one with archive/reload actions and one with delete. The optimistic insert now replaces any entry the broadcast added, so the locally cached session (with its delete action and draft support) always wins.
- 3930505: Fix the "Catching up…" badge sometimes staying visible after a session goes idle. The stream catch-up mode was tracked by two fields that could drift — a private guard and the public badge flag — and the socket reconnect path updated one without the other, so the terminating idle status no longer cleared the badge. Both facets now route through a single source of truth, and any idle status for the selected session reliably dismisses the badge.
- 411e61a: Declutter the chat composer bar with icon-based actions. The Send, Queue, Steer, and Stop buttons are now compact icons, the Attach button moved into the message box, and the thinking level is shown as a small gauge whose bars reflect the levels available for the current model. This leaves more room on narrow/mobile layouts while keeping the model selector readable. All controls retain accessible labels and tooltips. Thinking levels are now sourced from pi directly, so an unfamiliar level from a newer pi version is still selectable and displayed gracefully instead of causing an error.
- d17050e: Add image attachments to the chat composer. You can now paste (Ctrl/Cmd+V), drag-and-drop, or use the new Attach button to add PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images to a message, with thumbnail previews and multi-image support. Attachments are delivered to the session using pi's native image format (images are auto-resized to pi's inline limits for full compatibility), and image content now renders inline in the transcript. A per-message delivery toggle also lets you instead save attachments into the workspace `.omp-web/attachments` folder and reference them so the agent reads them with its own tools. The accepted HTTP upload size is now configurable via `OMP_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` or the `maxUploadBytes` config value.
- 3c6b4a4: Run the suggested Linux restart commands inside a detached transient systemd user service (`systemd-run --user`) instead of directly. The restart now completes even when the launching PI WEB terminal is killed by restarting the session daemon, and its output can be inspected with `journalctl --user -u omp-web-restart`.
- 61f0b79: Move reload to the end of the session action menu.
- 82db15f: Add a **Reload** action to the session three-dot menu that re-reads the session from disk. The session daemon keeps an in-memory `SessionManager` per session and never re-reads the session file, so when the same session is also driven by another process (for example the `pi` CLI), new on-disk entries were invisible to the web UI and the tail of the conversation appeared truncated. Reloading closes the active session, re-opens it from disk, discards the cached transcript, and re-fetches the history.

  Reload is also available from the command palette as **Reload Session**, so it can be triggered from the keyboard and assigned a custom shortcut. Reload refuses to run while the session has work in progress and on archived (read-only) sessions, and is gated behind a new `sessions.reload` runtime capability so it only appears for machines whose Omp-Web runtime supports it (both the menu item and the palette action are disabled otherwise).

  Note: this changes a session daemon code path, so `omp-web-sessiond.service` must be restarted manually for the server side of this change to take effect.

- 95c1512: Let agents start new sessions with a `spawn_session` tool. An agent can dispatch a fresh, independent session with an initial prompt — useful for ralph-style loops (an agent kicks off the next iteration when done) and for chaining long plans across sessions. Spawned sessions are normal sessions a human can open and interact with, and they now appear in the session list the moment they are created (in the matching workspace) without a manual reload.

  To keep every spawned session visible and controllable, an agent may only spawn into a workspace — any worktree, including one it just created — of the same registered project as the spawning session. The capability is on by default and can be toggled under Settings → Session daemon (or via the `spawnSessions` config key / `OMP_WEB_SPAWN_SESSIONS` environment variable); changes take effect after the session daemon restarts.

  Note: this adds a session daemon code path, so `omp-web-sessiond.service` must be restarted manually for the server side of this change to take effect.

- 3c6b4a4: Make the Updates panel actionable: every suggested command now has both a Copy and a Run button (Run executes it in a workspace terminal), a single recommended all-in-one command is shown at the top so users do not have to choose, and the remaining commands are grouped as clearly optional additional commands.

## 1.202606.3

### Patch Changes

- c0d1222: Fix sessions outside the server's launch directory being invisible: listing returned no sessions and opening them failed with 404 "Session not found", leaving the model picker empty. Working directories are now normalized at the API boundary and when reading stored session data, so path differences (trailing slashes, redundant segments, and Windows backslash vs forward-slash forms) no longer hide live or archived sessions. Requests with a relative `cwd` are now rejected with a 400 error instead of being resolved against the server's own working directory. Requires Pi coding agent SDK 0.78.0 or newer.
- 38cf334: Restart the web/UI services before the session daemon in the suggested "Restart all" command and `omp-web restart`, so running the command from a PI WEB terminal still restarts the UI even though restarting the session daemon kills the terminal.

- b2a7975: Align the desktop machine badge status to the right edge of the badge.
- a3b5b72: Add safe bulk session actions for archiving current sessions and permanently deleting archived sessions, with runtime capability checks for remote compatibility.
- 9dd59c0: Show model response errors in the chat transcript instead of leaving the conversation blank.
- 4bc390a: Keep machine/session navigation snappy by deferring expensive Omp-Web status refreshes and caching status checks.
- 577594a: Allow sidebar action/detail menus to expand beyond their list section when only a few rows are shown.
- f501f9d: Pin navigation activity indicators to the top-right of list chips so active projects, workspaces, and sessions no longer shift their labels.

- 2631a63: Add persistent project, workspace, and session context in the web UI so mobile users keep their location visible while navigating between panels and chat.
- 3da2fcf: Add in-place overflow lenses for workspace rows so truncated workspace labels and plugin links can be read or clicked, and cap long project and session names to two lines.
- 894c4d0: Avoid automatically reselecting archived-only sessions unless an archived session was explicitly selected, and let closing the archived section clear archived session selection.
- cf1b0ed: Replace the workspace hover lens with a workspace actions/details menu so metadata remains accessible without blocking list scrolling or shifting rows.
- ea5d863: Preserve chat scroll positions more reliably across session and workspace changes, and keep live event groups collapsed when users close them during streaming.
- 0a086c9: Keep action-palette plugin actions responsive when they change workspace tools or routes.
- 3cce6d2: Rework chat scroll restoration around explicit bottom and anchor positions so session navigation and streaming updates keep the user's reading position stable.
- e5bc87b: Add a Go to Terminal action with a keyboard shortcut and clarify that plugin shortcuts are default keybindings attached to actions.

## 1.202605.10

### Patch Changes

## 1.202605.8

### Patch Changes

- c77c47c: Document the Pi Web CalVer release rule so releases use the release month, increment the patch component for additional releases in the same month, and require explicit user confirmation before any breaking major release.
- 3099579: Document and tighten the Pi Web plugin API around explicit `ompWeb.plugins` metadata, versioned browser modules, AI-oriented local plugin development, website plugin docs on omp-web.dev, feedback guidance, and resilient discovery that skips invalid plugins without hiding valid ones.

- 42b9c53: Remove unsupported direct GitHub install instructions from the README.

## 1.202605.5

### Patch Changes

- a807569: Fix browser terminal sizing so progress/status lines update in place instead of wrapping when the PTY size has not caught up with the visible terminal.
- d064c4e: Improve package gallery discoverability for remote web UI and browser control plane searches.

## 1.202605.4

### Patch Changes

- 7a9e7db: Copying selected rendered chat markdown now places the raw markdown source on the clipboard.
